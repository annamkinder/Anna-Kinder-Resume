<details><summary>PowerBI</summary>
  <h4> Description: </h4>
  I completed the <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/analyzing-and-visualizing-data-with-power-bi-0">Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Power BI</a> course on edX. I learned how to create and edit a dashboard, create a report based off excel data, and better interpret data. These skills will help me in the future if I ever need to put together data and present it. PowerBI allows users to better understand the information they are looking at and help point out the most important aspects. Using this traning, I was abe to complete my own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKjC5Wvp-Rc&feature=youtu.be">PowerBI Dashboard</a> using sample data.

<details><summary>AlgoVPN</summary>
  <h4> Description: </h4>
  I configured a VPN in the cloud using the Algo VPN Ansible scripts provided by Trail of Bits. With the help of this tutorial, I successfully deployed the Algo server, configured the VPN clients, set up an SSH tunnel, and added/removed users. Though challenging, this skill taught me more than just how to configure a VPN. I was able to use troubleshooting skills and working with fellow classmates to help solve this difficult task. If I ever need to build a VPN again, I have the experience to help guide me through the process.

<details><summary>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</summary>
  <h4> Description: </h4>
  I completed the AWS Essentials training on Linux Academy. This training was very helpful because it provided hands on acitivities, along with videos. Through this training, I was able to set up my own AWS account and apply it. I was able to demonstrate this by setting up an OpenVPN and IPSecVPN using the AWS platform. A large number of companies are moving towards using AWS, and this traning helped me better understand why.

<details><summary>PowerShell</summary>
  <h4> Description: </h4>
  I completed LinkedIn's Premium PowerShell 5 Essential Training. In this training I learned how to install Windows Management Framework 5, run commands, discover commands, find and use local modules, select, store, and filter object data, create scripts, automate tasks, and use PowerShell remotely. I was taught how to get help from the help system, extend Powershell with modules and snap-ins, and automate administrative tasks.

<details><summary>Automation Anywhere</summary>
  <h4> Description: </h4>
  I completed a portion of the Automation Anywhere University Essential Level Prep Courses (MBA Students). I was very excited to learn more about Automation Anywhere because the company I am working for uses it to automate tasks. Though the training provided valuable information, the platform needs some work. I ran into multiple road blocks of not having permission to access courses and learning paths, but completed what I could on the track. This traning gave me a lot of background information into how processes are chosen for automation and how to prioritize what to automate. Additionally, I learned how basic bots work. I really like how Automation Anywhere is friendly towards someone who isn't an expert in programming, but still likes to do it. The pre-built functions allow me to build a bot with knowing the basics of programming.
